# How to 

run `./gg` to get system info! The stuff I am thinking about is info that would
be useful to know when you log into a remote - disk, memory, uptime, if you have
anything running (docker, tmux, etc)

### TODO
- [] Disk usage for Linux
- [] Memory usage for Linux
- [] Docker support
- [] Tmux support
- [] Anything else that might be nifty
